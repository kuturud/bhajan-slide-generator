## 📄 Data Format

### Bhajans (`bhajans.json`)

The bhajans library is loaded from `python/bhajans.json` (or `bhajans.json` in the root). Each bhajan has:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Bhajan Name",
  "lyrics": "First line\\nSecond line\\n\\nThird line (new stanza)"
}
```

**Key points**:
- `lyrics` uses `\n` for line breaks (real newlines in JSON)
- Blank lines (`\n\n`) separate stanzas/verses
- If no blank lines exist, lyrics are auto-grouped into 4-line verses
- Trailing notes in parentheses (e.g., `(Repeat 3X)`) are handled automatically

### Prayers (`prayers.json`)

The prayers library is loaded from `prayers.json`. Each prayer has:

```json
{
  "id": "lordGanesha",
  "title": "Lord Ganesha",
  "lyrics": "Prayer text in Sanskrit/original language\nWith line breaks",
  "translation": "English meaning or translation (optional)"
}
```

**Key points**:
- `translation` field is displayed in italics below the prayer text
- Empty `translation` is allowed (prayer-only slides)
- Supports multi-faith prayers (Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, Sikh, etc.)

## 🔍 Searching

Both the Bhajan Library and Prayers Library include search functionality:

- **Bhajan Search**: By default searches ID and name. Check "Search lyrics" to also search bhajan text.
- **Prayer Search**: By default searches key and title. Check "Search text" to also search prayer lyrics.
- **Clear Button**: Quickly reset search filters

The search is case-insensitive and updates results in real-time.

## 🎨 Slide Layouts

### Title Slide
- Uses `images/bhajan1.png` as background
- Centered layout with equidistant title and subtitle from center
- Title font: 54pt, white
- Subtitle font: 32pt, yellow
- Subtitle auto-fills with current date (e.g., "9th November 2025")

### Bhajan Slide
- Left-aligned layout
- Header (bhajan name): 40pt bold, white
- Lyrics: 34pt base font, white, auto-sized to fit content
- Background: Cycles through `images/bhajan2.png` to `bhajan10.png`
- Footer: Shows "Next: [next slide title]" in small text

### Prayer Slide
- Left-aligned layout
- Header (prayer title): 54pt bold, white
- Lyrics: 40pt base font, white
- Translation/meaning: Italics, white, smaller font (minimum 20pt)
- Background: Uses same cycling as bhajans, or custom per-prayer background
- Footer: Shows "Next: [next slide title]"

### Colors & Fonts
All text uses white (`#FFFFFF`) for maximum visibility on photo backgrounds. The app uses system fonts for broad compatibility.

## 🖼️ Backgrounds

### Default Backgrounds
- **Title slide**: `images/bhajan1.png` (fixed)
- **Other slides**: Cycles through `images/bhajan2.png` to `images/bhajan10.png`

### Custom Backgrounds
- **Upload Override**: Use the "Upload background" button to set a custom image for all slides (except title)
- **Per-Prayer Background**: Add a `background` field to any prayer in `prayers.json` with a relative path (e.g., `"background": "images/custom.png"`)

Backgrounds are embedded directly into the PowerPoint file, so the generated `.pptx` is self-contained.

## 💼 Workspace

The workspace table shows your current presentation setlist:

- **Drag to Reorder**: Rows are draggable; arrange slides in any order
- **Add Items**: 
  - Use "Add" buttons in the libraries to add prayers/bhajans
  - Use "Add by ID" for quick bhajan insertion
  - Use "Add Filler Slide" for blank slides
  - Use "Add New Blank" for custom bhajan entries
- **Edit Titles**: Click on titles in the workspace to edit them inline
- **Remove Items**: Click the "Remove" button on any row
- **Persistence**: The workspace is saved to `sessionStorage` and persists across page refreshes. It clears when you close the browser tab.

### Workspace Actions
- **Show Lyrics**: Expand any item to preview its lyrics
- **Edit Fields**: Some fields (title, gender, key) are editable inline

## 🎭 Theme

The app supports dark and light themes:

- **Toggle Theme**: Click "🌗 Toggle Theme" to switch between dark and light modes
- **Reset Theme**: Click "Reset Theme" to clear your preference and use the system default
- Theme preference is saved to `localStorage` and persists across sessions

## 🌐 Hosting on GitHub Pages

To deploy this app on GitHub Pages:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to **Pages** section
   - Select source: Deploy from a branch
   - Choose branch: `main` (or your default branch)
   - Choose folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

2. **Access Your Site**:
   - Your app will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
   - Example: `https://kuturud.github.io/bhajan-generator/`

3. **Verify Favicons Load**:
   - Favicons use relative paths (`images/favicon.png?v=1`) so they work correctly under a repo subpath
   - Cache-busters (`?v=1`) ensure icons refresh when updated

> **Note**: All paths in the app are relative (no leading `/`), ensuring compatibility with GitHub Pages subdirectory hosting.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Favicon Not Showing
If the favicon doesn't appear after deployment:
- **Hard Refresh**: Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) to bypass cache
- **Clear Browser Cache**: Favicons are aggressively cached by browsers
- **Check Path**: Ensure `images/favicon.png` exists in your repository
- **Update Cache-Buster**: Change `?v=1` to `?v=2` in `index.html` and redeploy

### Title Slide Text Offset/Misaligned
Early versions had title centering issues. If your title appears off-center:

![Title Offset Example](docs/title-slide-offset.png)
*Example of misaligned title (fixed in current version)*

**Solution**: The current version uses proper centering with `CENTER_OFFSET = 0.75` to position title and subtitle equidistant from the vertical center. Update to the latest version or check `scripts.js` for correct layout constants.

### Bhajans/Prayers Not Loading
- **CORS Error**: You must run the app via a web server (not `file://` protocol)
- **JSON Path**: Verify `bhajans.json` path matches `BHJ_JSON_PATH` in `scripts.js`
- **JSON Syntax**: Check for syntax errors in JSON files using a validator

### Presentation Generation Fails
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **PptxGenJS**: Ensure CDN link loads correctly (check browser console for errors)
- **File Size**: Very large images may cause generation to slow down or fail

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Future enhancements under consideration:

- **Pagination for Long Prayers**: Automatically split prayers longer than X lines across multiple slides
- **Fixed-Size Typography**: Option to lock font sizes instead of auto-scaling
- **Export/Import Setlists**: Save and load workspace configurations as JSON
- **Tags/Categories**: Filter bhajans by deity, theme, or language
- **Multi-language Support**: UI translations
- **Slide Templates**: Additional layout options and color schemes
- **Offline Support**: Service worker for offline functionality
